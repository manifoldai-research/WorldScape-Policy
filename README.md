## 📖 Overview

World Action Models jointly model future visual state transitions and robot actions, providing a natural interface for robot planning and controllable execution. However, existing WAMs are often limited by short temporal context and coarse episode-level language supervision. Besides, most existing WAMs rely primarily on text-only conditioning and lack support for video prompting. Consequently, they cannot readily acquire or imitate new behaviors from visual demonstrations provided at inference time, substantially limiting their capacity for example-driven in-context learning—analogous to how large language models learn from demonstrations in context.

WorldScape Policy 2.0 addresses this limitation by introducing multimodal controllability and reasoning-augmented memory. It supports text instructions, goal images, and demonstration videos as interchangeable conditioning signals, enabling fine-grained instruction following, visual skill imitation, and long-horizon autonomous planning within a unified world-action policy.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Reasoning-augmented memory:** Short-term visual memory incorporates recent observations through causal prefill to preserve local interaction dynamics, while long-term event memory organizes historical reasoning outputs into hierarchical representations for progress-aware retrieval.
- **Latent autonomous planning:** A vision-language model autoregressively generates latent planning tokens conditioned on the task instruction, current observation, and retrieved event history, enabling adaptive long-horizon decision-making.
- **Diverse interaction modes:** A unified world-action policy supports high-level task instructions, fine-grained language commands, goal-image prompts, and one-shot human demonstrations for visual in-context learning.
- **Event-grounded pretraining:** Temporally localized events are aligned with language descriptions, visual prompts, video demonstrations, and action trajectories, providing fine-grained supervision beyond conventional episode-level annotations.
- **Joint video-action modeling:** The WAM jointly predicts future three-view visual observations and robot actions under a diffusion-based training objective, grounding action generation in anticipated scene dynamics.
- **Multi-embodiment transfer:** Cross-dataset pretraining preserves embodiment-specific action adapters within a shared model, while post-training selects and exports a single adapter specialized for the target robot.

## 🧠 Autonomous Planning and Instruction Following

Text-conditioned training and inference support two exchangeable modes:

- **Auto:** autonomous planning. The high-level instruction and head-camera observation are wrapped by the VLM planning prompt. Qwen3-VL generates latent conditions (subgoal / planning tokens) for the WAM after event memory retrieval.
- **Interactive:** instruction following. The fine-grained current task or atomic subtask instruction is encoded directly by T5 without VLM planning, which is then adopted by the WAM.

Select the appropriate mode with `WSP_MODE=auto` or `WSP_MODE=interactive`. Training and
evaluation must use checkpoints with matching modes.

## 🎬 In-Context Learning and Adaptation

Demonstration-video conditioning supports two complementary workflows:

- **One-shot in-context learning:** The pretrained model can directly use a single human demonstration video as a visual prompt at inference time and execute the demonstrated behavior without task-specific parameter updates.
- **Video-prompt adaptation:** For a new task or domain, users can collect their own demonstration videos and post-train the pretrained checkpoint with `VISUAL_PROMPT=demo`. The adapted model retains the same demonstration-conditioned inference interface while specializing to the target task, robot embodiment, and data distribution.

See [Demonstration-video conditioning](#3-demonstration-video-conditioning) for post-training and [Real-robot evaluation and deployment](#-real-robot-evaluation-and-deployment) for inference examples.

## 🛠️ Installation

The validated environment uses Python 3.11, PyTorch 2.8.0, CUDA 12.9,
TorchVision 0.23.0, and DeepSpeed 0.18.9.

```bash
# Conda
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate worldscape-policy

# Or an existing Python 3.11/3.12 environment
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .
```

Recipes resolve Python in this order: `WSP_PYTHON`, `CONDA_ENV/bin/python`,
the active `$CONDA_PREFIX`, then `python` from `PATH`.

```bash
export CONDA_ENV="$CONDA_PREFIX"
```

FlashAttention 2.8.3 is optional; PyTorch SDPA is the fallback. RoboTwin2 and the real-robot `manifold_msg` SDK must be installed from their upstream distributions when needed.

## 📊 Data Preparation

WorldScape Policy can train from raw HDF5 episodes or existing LeRobot v2 datasets. Before training, generate the native metadata required by the dataset adapters:

- Raw HDF5: add native metadata without rewriting the episode files.
- LeRobot v2: scan the existing Parquet/video data and add or refresh metadata.
- Full conversion: optionally convert HDF5 episodes into LeRobot Parquet and
MP4 files.

See the [data preparation guide](tools/data/README.md) for expected schemas,
conversion commands, output layouts, and validation steps.

Download the pre-trained checkpoint for fine-tuning:

```bash
export WSP_MODEL_ROOT="$HOME/models/worldscape-policy"
mkdir -p "$WSP_MODEL_ROOT"

hf download manifoldai-research/WorldScape-Policy-2 \
  --include "wsp_2_pretrain/**" \
  --local-dir "$WSP_MODEL_ROOT"

export PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH="$WSP_MODEL_ROOT/wsp_2_pretrain"
```

Download the RoboTwin 2.0 checkpoint for inference:

```bash
hf download manifoldai-research/WorldScape-Policy-2 \
  --include "wsp_2_posttrain_robotwin2_c2r/**" \
  --local-dir "$WSP_MODEL_ROOT"

export ROBOTWIN2_EVAL_MODEL_PATH="$WSP_MODEL_ROOT/wsp_2_posttrain_robotwin2_c2r"
```

The launchers place missing public base components below `WSP_MODEL_ROOT` and download them automatically. Set `WSP_AUTO_DOWNLOAD=false` for offline jobs, or override paths explicitly:

```bash
export WAN_CKPT_DIR="$WSP_MODEL_ROOT/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B"
export CLIP_CKPT_DIR="$WSP_MODEL_ROOT/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P"
export TOKENIZER_DIR="$WSP_MODEL_ROOT/umt5-xxl"
export Qwen_CKPT_DIR="$WSP_MODEL_ROOT/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct"
```

Training loads checkpoints in this order:

1. latest complete `checkpoint-N` in `OUTPUT_DIR`;
2. `PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH`;
3. the base components above.

Every saved `checkpoint-N/` is both resumable and evaluable. Evaluation requires the complete native directory, including `model.safetensors.index.json` and all `model-00001-of-0000N.safetensors` shards (or an unsharded `model.safetensors`), `checkpoint_manifest.json`, `transform_bundle.json`, and `.complete`. New checkpoints use 5 GB Hugging Face shards by default; override this with `CHECKPOINT_MAX_SHARD_SIZE` (for example, `10GB`).

## 🚀 Real-Robot Fine-Tuning on Your Own Data

AgileX post-training consumes HDF5 episodes with synchronized head, left-wrist, and right-wrist images, EEF state/actions, and task/subtask metadata. Set the common inputs first:

```bash
export CONDA_ENV="$CONDA_PREFIX"
export PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH="$WSP_MODEL_ROOT/wsp_2_pretrain"
export DATA_ROOT=/data/agilex-task
export NUM_GPUS=8
```

### 1. Text-Instruction Conditioning

Configuration:

- `VISUAL_PROMPT=none`
- `NATIVE_DATASET_NAME=worldscape_hdf5_text`
- `WSP_MODE=auto` for autonomous planning
- `WSP_MODE=interactive` for direct instruction following

See [Post-training: Text-instruction prompts](docs/posttraining.md#text-instruction-prompts)
for prompt templates, source-field parsing, and semantic-target handling.

```bash
# Autonomous planning
WSP_MODE=auto RUN_NAME=fold-shirt-auto \
  ./recipes/posttrain/posttrain_agilex_fold_shirt_text.sh

# Instruction following
WSP_MODE=interactive RUN_NAME=fold-shirt-interactive \
  ./recipes/posttrain/posttrain_agilex_fold_shirt_text.sh
```

### 2. Goal-Image Conditioning

Configuration:

- `VISUAL_PROMPT=goal`
- `NATIVE_DATASET_NAME=worldscape_hdf5_goal`
- default `WSP_MODE=interactive`

```bash
DATA_ROOT=/data/build-block-goal RUN_NAME=build-block-goal \
  ./recipes/posttrain/posttrain_agilex_build_block_goal.sh
```

### 3. Demonstration-Video Conditioning

Configuration for In-Context Adaptation:

- `VISUAL_PROMPT=demo`
- `NATIVE_DATASET_NAME=worldscape_hdf5_demo`
- default `WSP_MODE=interactive`

```bash
# Skill imitation
DATA_ROOT=/data/build-block-demo RUN_NAME=build-block-demo \
  ./recipes/posttrain/posttrain_agilex_build_block_demo.sh

# Visual Reasoning
DATA_ROOT=/data/shell-game-demo RUN_NAME=shell-game-demo \
  ./recipes/posttrain/posttrain_agilex_shell_game_demo.sh
```

Use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 NUM_GPUS=1` for single-GPU debugging. For multiple nodes, set `MLP_WORKER_NUM`, `MLP_ROLE_INDEX`, `MLP_WORKER_0_HOST`, `MLP_WORKER_0_PORT`, and the per-node `NUM_GPUS`.

## 🤖 Real-Robot Evaluation and Deployment

Always test with read-only HDF5 replay before enabling robot actuation:

```bash
export CONDA_ENV="$CONDA_PREFIX"
export FOLD_SHIRT_TEXT_EVAL_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/checkpoint
export WORLDSCAPE_HDF5_EPISODE=/data/replay/episode.hdf5
export WSP_MODE=auto
export WSP_INSTRUCTION="Fold the T-shirt into a rectangle."

AGILEX_TRANSPORT=hdf5 \
  ./recipes/eval/eval_agilex_fold_shirt_text.sh
```

Live deployment:

```bash
export AGILEX_TRANSPORT=manifold
export WSP_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
export WSP_SERVER_PORT=11451
export WSP_NODE_NAME=WSP

./recipes/eval/eval_agilex_fold_shirt_text.sh
```

The launcher enables `--live-hardware` only for `AGILEX_TRANSPORT=manifold`. Install the robot-side `manifold_msg` SDK and verify joint limits, emergency stop, workspace clearance, and network isolation before deployment.

Other interaction types use their task checkpoint and launcher. The following
commands are live-hardware examples and require the same safety checks:

```bash
# Goal-Conditioned Policy: Act to goal
AGILEX_TRANSPORT=manifold \
BUILD_BLOCK_GOAL_EVAL_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/checkpoint \
WSP_GOAL_IMAGE=/data/prompts/goal.png \
./recipes/eval/eval_agilex_build_block_goal.sh

# In-Context Learning: Skill imitation tasks
AGILEX_TRANSPORT=manifold \
BUILD_BLOCK_DEMO_EVAL_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/checkpoint \
./recipes/eval/eval_agilex_build_block_demo.sh

# In-Context Learning: Visual reasoning tasks
AGILEX_TRANSPORT=manifold \
SHELL_GAME_DEMO_EVAL_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/checkpoint \
./recipes/eval/eval_agilex_shell_game_demo.sh
```



## 🪿 RoboTwin 2.0 Evaluation

RoboTwin 2.0 evaluation follows the official evaluation interface and workflow. For convenience, a copy of the official RoboTwin repository is included under `third_party/RoboTwin`, with several local modifications applied to accelerate evaluation. Before running evaluation, follow the official instructions in `third_party/RoboTwin/README.md` to install the environment and download the required assets. The manager creates `third_party/RoboTwin/policy/wsp2_policy` automatically; an equivalent manual setup is:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/experiments/robotwin/wsp2_policy" \
  third_party/RoboTwin/policy/wsp2_policy
```

Clean-only training:

```bash
DATA_ROOT=/data/robotwin2-clean \
ZSCORE_STATS_PATH=/data/robotwin2-clean/dataset_stats.json \
PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH="$WSP_MODEL_ROOT/wsp_2_pretrain" \
NUM_GPUS=8 ./recipes/posttrain/posttrain_robotwin2.sh
```

For the full dataset:

```bash
DATA_ROOT=/data/robotwin2-full \
ZSCORE_STATS_PATH=/data/robotwin2-full/dataset_stats.json \
PRETRAINED_MODEL_PATH="$WSP_MODEL_ROOT/wsp_2_pretrain" \
NUM_GPUS=8 ./recipes/posttrain/posttrain_robotwin2_full.sh
```

Evaluation uses 14-D absolute joint actions, 24-step chunks, nine
rolling observation frames, and one persistent model per GPU worker:

```bash
ROBOTWIN2_EVAL_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/checkpoint \
ROBOTWIN_ROOT="$(pwd)/third_party/RoboTwin" \
ROBOTWIN_GPU_IDS='[0,1,2,3]' \
./recipes/eval/eval_robotwin2.sh
```

See `experiments/robotwin/README.md` for single-task and manager examples. RoboTwin assets and separately downloaded models remain subject to their own distribution and use terms.
